DESCRIPTION-
------------

This project is based on current war between Russia and Ukraine which had started on 24 FEBRUARY 2022.

This is a multiplayer aircraft war game which allows two users to play an aircraft face to face battle
to decide which side may emerge victorious.
The objective is to survive till end by dodging enemie's attacks and counterfiring on it to destroy the enemy.
Each player has a maximum life of 100 initially.
Each time the bullet hits the body of the plane it will reduce the health by 10%, shown in the health bar.
When health becomes 0 the game will be over.
After that the final message of victory or loss will be shown on the screen and then automatically the game window will be closed after 6 seconds.
We can quit the game anytime inbetween by clicking the cross button on the upper right corner.
It will allow diagonal movements for the aircrafts and we can move them in different directions by pressing multiple keys at a time.
The aircrafts movements are restricted to the window's borders only so that they may not leave the game screen.
We can move from multiple aircrafts at a time, we can also fire shots from both the plane at same time.
To develop this game I have used python 3.9.0 and pycharm IDE
Images along with pygame functionalities are used for UI
and are placed in asset folder, which acts as an asset to this project
